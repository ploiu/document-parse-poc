This is just a poc to see how to extract specific limited properties from an ooxml word document into a POJO.

This project won't go anywhere, but may go towards my [file server project](https://github.com/ploiu/file_server) to generate small file previews. The goal there is to use [sxd-document](https://crates.io/crates/sxd-document) and [sxd-xpath](https://crates.io/crates/sxd-xpath)

Side note, ths ooxml standard is one of the worst things I have ever seen in my programming career.
